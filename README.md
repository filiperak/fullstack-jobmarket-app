# MERN Stack job search app

This MERN stack job search app provides users with a comprehensive platform to search, create, and apply for jobs. The web application includes features like user authentication, real-time messaging, and notifications to enhance user experience.

To get started, users need to create a profile and log in. Once logged in, they can search for jobs using various filters and criteria tailored to their preferences. Users can then apply to jobs, and their applications are instantly submitted to the job poster. Job posters have the ability to browse through all applicants and either accept or decline applications. Applicants receive immediate updates on their application status.

Additionally, if users have any questions about a job, they can send direct messages to the job poster, enabling seamless communication throughout the job application process.
